Instagram Follow Button Feature
This feature replicates an "Instagram Follow" button, designed to simulate the functionality of toggling between "Follow" and "Following" states. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it serves as a hands-on practice project to enhance JavaScript skills. The button dynamically updates its text and style upon interaction, providing a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates the power of JavaScript in creating interactive web elements and highlights proficiency in handling DOM events and state management.
